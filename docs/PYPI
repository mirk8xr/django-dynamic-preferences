Create a .pypirc configuration file
-----------------------------------

This file holds your information for authenticating with PyPI, both the live and the test versions.

[distutils]
index-servers =
  pypi
  testpypi

[pypi]
repository=https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/
username=your_username
password=your_password

[pypitest]
repository=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
username=your_username
password=your_password


This is just to make your life easier, so that when it comes time to upload you don't have to type/remember your
username and password. Make sure to put this file in your home folder â€“ its path should be ~/.pypirc.
Because this file holds your username and password, you may want to change its permissions so that only you can read
and write it. From the terminal, run:

chmod 600 ~/.pypirc


Upload your package to PyPI Test
--------------------------------

Run:
python setup.py sdist upload -r testpypi

You should get no errors, and should also now be able to see your library in the test PyPI repository.


Upload to PyPI Live
-------------------

Once you've successfully uploaded to PyPI Test, perform the same steps but point to the live PyPI server instead.
Run:
python setup.py sdist upload -r pypi

and you're done!
